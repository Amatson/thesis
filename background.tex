%% TODO: Briefly about machine learning in general

Machine learning is part of the artificial intelligence field.
Typically, machine learning refers to %% TODO: something something data

Machine learning usage has become more common
and is nowadays widely used in many fields,
not just general information technology and computer science.
This is because data can be gathered everywhere,
and where there is data to be processed,
machine learning can be there to process it.
%% TODO: Makes any sense? References!

Machine learning divides commonly in several categories,
which are explored briefly in the next section.


\subsection{Machine learning field}\label{subsec:bg-ml-field}
%% TODO: Open up ML algorithms and learning methods

\subsubsection*{ML training}
Machine learning algorithms can be trained in two basic ways:
supervised and unsupervised learning.

In supervised learning,
algorithm is given data with ready answers on
how the data needs to be interpreted.
Algorithm then tries to figure out
how given data and the correct answers are related.

In unsupervised learning,
on the other hand,
algorithm does not get model data from which to train itself,
but instead it tries to find clusters or groups inside the data
that are linked together more closely than to other parts of data.
%% TODO: REFERENCES AND SUCH

Typically,
when training an algorithm,
some predefined portion of the data
is used as training data.
%% TODO: How much? Sources!
The rest is used to validate the results
so that validation data and training data do not overlap.
Instead, trained algorithm is given data it has not seen before
and the result it produces with it is then validated.
For example,
in supervised learning
the key values the algorithm is trained to find out
are hidden from the validation data.
The resulting values produced by the algorithm
are compared to those hidden values
and the difference between the estimate and the real value
can be used to determine how well the current algorithm compares to others.

%% TODO: next one might change!
However, in this study,
we are going to break that rule
about non-overlapping training and validation data.
The reason for this is explained further in section~\ref{subsec:rmm-ml-methods-and-pipelines})

\subsubsection*{ML algorithms}
Algorithms are the main "magic" inside machine learning. %% TODO: Omstart?
They can be generally divided into <four> categories %% TODO: check

Regression algorithms predict values
and are typically used with supervised learning.
%% TODO: give examples? House market price?

Classification algorithms predict categories.
Depending on the algorithm,
they can predict between two or several categories.
%% TODO: Examples?

Clustering algorithms use unsupervised learning
to find structures inside data.

Anomaly detection algorithms work also unsupervised
and try to find unusual or rare data points from data.

%% TODO: need more info? Opening up?

\subsection{Cloud ML platforms}\label{subsec:bg-cloud-ml-platforms}
%% TODO: Briefly about Azure, Google and AWS

Machine learning algorithms are not light to operate.
Depending on the amount of data,
it can be a serious %% TODO: What? How big?

Especially with online applications
where real time analysis of new input data is required,
cloud computing resources can make a huge difference
in terms of processing speed. %% TODO: refs maybe?

Online market offers several solutions for ML computing in cloud.

Google

Amazon AWS(?)

Microsoft Azure\cite{altexsoft}
