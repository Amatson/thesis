% In LaTeX, the spacing between sentences is longer than the spacing between words.
% By default, LaTeX treats periods followed by a whitespace as ends of sentence.
% This leads to incorrect behaviour when using abbreviations like "e.g." or "cf.".
% To get correct spacing, use the following commands, like this: "Some periods, \eg these ones, do not end a sentence."
\newcommand{\ie}{i.\,e.\ }
\newcommand{\eg}{e.\,g.\ }
\newcommand{\cf}{cf.\ }
\newcommand\etc{etc.\ }

% Uppercase versions for use at start of sentence
\newcommand{\Ie}{I.\,e.\ }
\newcommand{\Eg}{E.\,g.\ }

% When etc. is used as the sentence-final or phrase-final word, \etc would erroneously inject a between-words space.
% In those cases, you can just write "etc." by hand instead of using the command.
% If you would prefer a command, use \etcFinal{} (the curly braces are important).
% Example for sentence-final use: "Uses are A, B, C, \etcFinal{}. The next sentence..."
% Example for phrase-final use: "Its various uses, such as A, B, C, \etcFinal{}., are well known."
\newcommand\etcFinal{etc}


\newcommand{\todo}[1]{\begin{center}\texttt{TODO: #1}\end{center}}
