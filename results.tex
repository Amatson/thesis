\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

%% TODO: preface for the section
%We start this section by looking at
%the Azure resources needed for ML training
%both in general Azure environment and in ML Studio.
%Next we analyze the results of
%different ML algorithms and pipelines.

\todo{Contents of this section has been reorganized to methods and pipeline -sections. Final results are still gathered. Below is some quickly written notes, subjected to change.}

Even though with rawmessage we were forced to reduce the data amount significantly,
it was seen as valuable data source
as it included more data than pure message had in JSON structure.
As data amount was skimmed to less than 1\% of the original amount,
the results may not be reliable.
However, with rawmessage preprocessing used
with decision forest regression,
the coefficient of determination was over 0.35.
