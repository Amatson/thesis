\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

This thesis study investigated possibilities to utilize machine learning
in order to predict technical ticket arrival
based on RPA log events and ticket timestamps
using anomaly detection.
Several steps were required before the actual algorithm training could be initialized.

First,
the data had to be anonymized.
We compared the possible outcome of full anonymization of sensitive data
with pseudonymization and k-anonymization.
Data security restrictions and the probable type of log events inducing technical tickets
settled us to choose full anonymization,
which was carried out with PowerShell script in production environment.

Next,
local data preprocessing was needed
before the data was deemed suitable for ML training.
As data consisted of miscellaneous types of input,
we had to create another script to reformat the data in a consistent form.

After this,
the proper ML training steps in Azure ML Studio environment could begin.
One of the main problems we had to solve
was how to combine log events with simple timestamp data of the technical tickets
with an unknown span of random delay.
We decided to use hybrid machine learning
fused with time frame compression method
to avoid the random delay issue.
This, however,
leaned heavily on the hypothesis that most anomalous log events
are related to technical tickets received.
This hypothesis had to be validated
by comparing the results of the final algorithm training
with an ML pipeline branch where anomaly values had been removed.

In order to find the best possible combination of ML components for hybrid machine learning
both in terms of suitable algorithms and input data features,
several combinations were tested and compared with each other.
In the end, however,
it became clear that
either our original hypothesis had to be assumed incorrect
and anomalous events are not linked to technical support tickets,
or more studying is required to find the connection between the log events and ticket timestamps.
