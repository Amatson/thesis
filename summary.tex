<Sum up here what we did and why>

\subsection{Discussion}\label{subsec:discussion}
<Here some thinking what should have been improved>

\subsubsection*{Data formatting}
The most time-consuming tasks in the study
was without a doubt
the anonymization and preformatting of the data.
Although sensitive information may sometimes be crucial in error fixing
as problems may consider just one client,
it is necessary that the data sanitation is possible to do
in order to use the data in less secure environment.
By preformatting the data in such way
that all different personal information types
do not differ between use cases.
%% TODO: hetu in weird form


\subsubsection*{Possible ML methods}
Some sort of time delay forecasting?\cite{erharter2021pointlessness}
Could we estimate the number of tickets
based on some log metrics in time frame?
